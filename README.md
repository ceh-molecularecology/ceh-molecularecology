- 👋 Hi, we're @ceh-molecularecology, the group for all things [Molecular Ecology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/science-departments/soil-and-land-use#undefined) at [UKCEH](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/)
- 👀 We're interested in biodiversity and function of biotic communities in terrestrial and freshwater environments
- 🌱 We use state-of-the-art sequencing approaches to examine how natural and anthropogenic pressures impact the structure and function of biodiversity, from microbes to vertebrates.
- 💞️📫 To collaborate or reach us, feel free to email [Dr. Daniel Read](dasr@ceh.ac.uk)
